# DevOps Workshops

Welcome to the ***DevOps Workshops*** Project! Below you will find links to each individual workshop with documentation collated for each. These will, hopefully, contain a whole bunch of relevant information, steps and excercises to get you familiarised with DevOps and how we can implement and utilise within a business.

I am by no means an expert and this is more the documentation of my learnings and finding ways to improve upon them where possible. Feedback, corrections and suggestions are welcome on this documentation to help grow it into a relevant training path for employees interested in getting started within their organisations.
